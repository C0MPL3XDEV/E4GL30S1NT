## Setup and Dependencies

To ensure all necessary Python packages and type stubs are installed for `E4GL30S1NT.py`, please run the provided shell script:

First, make sure the script is executable:
\`\`\`bash
chmod +x install_deps.sh
\`\`\`

Then, run the script:
\`\`\`bash
./install_deps.sh
\`\`\`

This script will:
1. Install core runtime libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Install `types-botocore` and `types-boto3` as per user preference.
3. Run `mypy --install-types` to fetch other necessary type stubs for `E4GL30S1NT.py`.

## Debugging

This script includes an example for using `debugpy` to debug its execution. To use it:

1.  Ensure `debugpy` is installed. You can install it using pip:
    \`\`\`bash
    pip install debugpy
    \`\`\`
    (The `install_deps.sh` script also attempts to install type stubs via `mypy`, which might include `debugpy` if it's imported and type stubs are available).
2.  In the `E4GL30S1NT.py` script, find the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
3.  Uncomment the section related to `debugpy` setup.
4.  Run the script. It will print a message and pause, waiting for a debugger to attach on port 5678 (or the configured port).
5.  Attach your Python debugger (e.g., from VS Code, PyCharm) to the specified port.
